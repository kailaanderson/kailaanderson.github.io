                <h1>Stay FM</h1>
                <p style="text-align: center;">This web application was designed to create a warm, cozy environment for the viewers of "Stay FM"
                    (content created by Lee Felix of Stray Kids) to enjoy the videos.</p>
            </div>

            <!--Introduction-->
            <div class="element" id="section1">
                <h1>Project Introduction</h1>
                <p>Lee Felix is a member of boyband Stray Kids. In 2020, he created a segment ‘Stay FM.’ to teach his fans common Australian 
                    phrases in the form of ASMR. This segment includes four videos with over 2 Million views each. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Problem Statement-->
            <div class="element">
                <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                <p>With these videos having been created 4 years ago, it is difficult for fans of the section to find them. There is no
                    official playlist for Stay F.M., causing the segment to be buried under the rest of Stray Kids’ videos over the years. 
                    I want to design a website centered on Stay F.M. that will provide users with quick and easy access to Stay F.M. videos
                    and highlight the Australian phrases mentioned in each video
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Ideation-->
            <div class="element" id="section2">
                <h1>Ideation</h1>
                <p></p>

            </div>

            <!--Research Details-->
            <div class="element" id="section3">
                <h1>Research Details</h1>
                <h2>Social Media Research</h2>
                <p>I conducted my research through comment sections under the videos as well as social media
                     posts about the episodes. With this research I will gain a better understanding of the target audience and 
                     elements of the segment that stood out to the audience that I may encorporate into the design.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Findings-->
            <div class="element">
                <h1>Findings</h1>
                <p>The audience for this content spans from teenagers to adults, majority of the audience being Young Adults. Within 
                    each episode I was able to find common threads of things the audience liked and disliked about the videos, why 
                    they watched them, and the feeling they got from watching them.
                </p>
                <h2>Invoking Feeling and Eliminating Distractions</h2>
                <p>Fans enjoyed the relaxing and calm aspect of the ASMR videos. Viewers noted how Felix’s
                    voice helped to soothe them while others noted that his warm smile and enjoyment was their favorite part.</p>
                <p>However, in 50% of the videos, viewers commented on how the captions would say “music” or “applauding” while Felix was 
                    either speaking or creating ASMR sounds. With this in mind, I wanted to add a feature where users can choose 
                    between watching the Stay F.M. video or listening to the audio without the visual component, eliminating distractions for viewers./p>
                <p>Lastly, viewers commented on quotes from the video that they enjoyed. This is a nice addition to give the design a warm feel.</p>
                <h2>When Viewers Engage in Content</h2>
                <p>Many viewers watched this video content after a hard day, finding comfort in sitting 
                    down and relaxing with Felix for a few moments. Additionally, viewers watched directly before getting 
                    ready for bed or falling asleep.</p>
                <p>Roughly 40% of comments mentioned the warm feeling they received from watching these videos. I strove to portray 
                    the warm and comfortable feeling from each episode with a warm color palette. I also kept the UI simple, using few 
                    controls to ensure that users that are ready to fall asleep have easy usability.

            <!--Moodboard-->

                <h1>Moodboard</h1>
                <img src="assets/Moodboard.png">
                <p>The reference photos identify the warm feeling I want to capture throughout the website. I will be using the Brown, Green,
                    and Orange as the website’s primary colors while the red, lighter brown, and tan will be used as secondary colors. 
                </p>
                <h2>Header</h2>
                <img src="assets/FelixFMHeader.png">
                <p>This header was created using Adobe photoshop. It has a radio theme and uses the 
                    Brown primary color as well as red and tan secondary colors.</p>

            <!--Wireframes-->

                <img src="assets/StayFM Groups/Comparison.jpg">
                <p>The user has the option to toggle the video display. When the video is toggled off, 
                    the audio continues at the same point in the video. 
                </p>

                <img src="assets/StayFM Groups/Single.jpg">
                <p>Each page for the episode includes a short description, telling the user the keyword of the episode,
                     the contents (reading, eating sweets, etc), and gives the user something to think about that is related 
                     to the episode. This design creates a connection between the user and the content.

                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>This project helped me practice a new form of user research through social media. 
                It was interesting to use comments and posts from common social media apps and translate those ideas
                into features on a website. The project also gave me an opportunity to improve my skills with adobe 
                photoshop and prototyping with Figma.
