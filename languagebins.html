                <h1>Language Bins</h1>
                <p style="text-align: center;">This app was designed to assist young adults in their language learning journey
                    by implementing organizational learning techniques and proving a mindful studying environment.</p>
            </div>

            <!--Introduction-->
            <div class="element" id="section1">
                <h1>Project Introduction</h1>
                <p>‘Language Bins’ is an app catered towards young adults learning new languages. This app will help them organize 
                    their studies and easily review what they already know, helping them to retain knowledge and encourage them to 
                    continue studying. </p>
            </div>

            <!--Problem Statement-->
            <div class="element">
                <h1>Initial Problem Statement</h1>
                <p>Learning a new language can be overwhelming with the amount of information that people learn. As a result, 
                    young adults learning new languages often give up their language learning journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Language Bin learning app will help young adults organize what they’ve learned into categories,
                         making language-learning less overwhelming. It will also help them study what they’ve learned,
                          encouraging them to continue their language learning journey.</p>

            <!--Research Methods-->
            <div class="element" id="section3">
                <h1>Research Details</h1>
                <h2>Survey Conduction</h2>
                <p>This survey asked young adults to sort features of the app into
                     specific categories.</p>
                <p>Features include: Learning Tips, Flashcard Creation, Flashcard Review, Lesson Summary,
                Lesson Review, and Studying Achievements.</p>
                <p>Categories Include: Initial Learning, Studying, and Additional Help/Encouragement.</p>
                <p>This survey helped me to logically group the features of the app in a way that makes sense
                    to the users, as well as get feedback on what they feel is missing or could be added from the draft of the app.</p>

                <h2>User Research - Color Theory in Learning</h2>
                <p>To enhance my problem statement, I also conducted research on language learning in young adults and
                   color theory for language learning to identify what colors work best for retaining knowledge.

            <!--Findings-->
            <div class="element">
                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p>Young adults have the advantage of having a better understanding of concepts, patterns, and making connections
                        when learning a new language, helping them to learn the concepts faster.

                </p>
                <p> Color psychology explains colors commonly used in education and what emotions they invoke in learners that helps
                    them retain information. Red and yellow are colors that catch learners attention,  while green helps with relaxation
                     and concentration. It is important to note that red and green are affected by color-blindness.

             <!--Updated Problem Statement-->
             <div class="element">
                <h2>Updated Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>Young adults are often overwhelmed by learning a new language because of the amount of information to retain, discouraging 
                    them from continuing their studies. By creating an app that utalizes categorization to aid in language learning,
                     young adults will feel encouraged to continue their language learning studies.

                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>This project enhanced my mobile designing and user research skills. I realized the importance in conducting user
                    tests as well, finding myself altering my initial ideation of the design based on the survey results. Researching also helped
                     me to create a color scheme that would be beneficial towards all users, keeping in mind colors that help retain information but
                    are also mindful towards those with color-blindness. Of all of my past projects, I have made the most wireframes 
                    for this one, challenging me to remain consistent and manage my time efficiently.
