                <h1>Instagram Website Redesign</h1>
                <p style="text-align: center;">I challenged myself to redesign the web application for Instagram and create a design that 
                    is consistent with the mobile app.</p>
            </div>

            <!--Introduction-->
            <div class="element" id="section1">
                <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
                <p>I use Instagram daily, as do many other young adults. However, I use it primarily on my mobile phone. I wanted to challenge 
                    myself to look into the UI/UX design of Instagram’s web application and try to improve the design.  
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="element">
                <h2>Home Page</h2>
                <p>I have decided to keep the look and structure of the reels, create, and profile section.
                     I feel that these sections of the app are in sync with the mobile app and make sense for the website. With 
                     that being said, I found a few changes that I could make within the home, search, explore, messages, and notifications 
                     on the website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When logging into Instagram, the first thing a user sees is their homepage. In the current design, I like that the
                     posts and stories are in the middle of the page, simulating the same feeling we get from the mobile application. 
                     Viewing and adding comments has easy functionality as well. However, I would like to explore different options within
                      the right margin.
                </p>

                <img src="assets/og-home.png" alt="Original Home Design">
                <p>
                    Currently there are profile suggestions and lots of blank space. While the middle section is the priority of the home screen,
                     I feel that the right margin space can be used more effectively.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second thing I noticed is the differences within the navigation bars. In the mobile app, the messages and notifications are 
                    separate from the bottom navigation bar. On the website however, they are added to the side navigation bar. Additionally, 
                    the elements in the navigation bar are in a different order on the website than the mobile app. In my redesign, I want to keep
                    the navigation bar consistent between the web app and the mobile app. 
                </p>
                <img src="assets/og-nav.png" alt="Website Navigation">
                <p>Website Navigation</p>
                <img src="assets/mobile-nav.jpeg" alt="Mobile Navigation">
                <p>Mobile Navigation</p>
            </div>

            <div class="element">
                <h2>Search and Explore Page</h2>
                <p>
                    In the mobile app, the search icon shows the users
                     explore page with a search bar at the top for any specific searches. However when moving to the web version, there are two
                      separate pages to view the explore page and to search. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my redesign, I will maintain consistency between the mobile and web versions by combining the search and explore pages. 
                    Additionally, in the mobile version, the user can search a keyword and have the option to view related results as “for you”,
                     “accounts”, “audio”, “tags”, “places”, and “reels” but when searching on the website the results are only posts. I will also 
                     maintain consistency by adding these filter options for search results. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Redesign Goals-->
            <div class="element" id="section2">
                <h2>Redesign Goals</h2>
                <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    <li>Create navigation similar to mobile app navigation</li>
                    <li>Give functionality to right margin</li>
                    <li>Combine Search and Explore Pages</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The updated navigation bar on the side reflects the mobile app navigation. The messages and notifications were moved

                <p>When the user selects the messages icon, messages will appear on the right margin. They can select a 
                    specific chatroom to open the full messages page.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Notifications</p>
                <img src="assets/redesign-notifs.png" alt="Notifications Redesign">
                <p>When the user selects the heart icon, the notifications will appear on the right hand side. They will stay on the right
                     as the user scrolls until they reselect the heart icon to close the notifications view.</p>

                <img src="assets/search3.png" alt="Seach Redesign">
                <p>The search icon now takes the user to the search and explore page, as structured in the mobile app. When searching, 
                    the user gets search suggestions. Once they complete their search, they have the option to look at for you suggestions, 
                    accounts, audios, tags, places, and reels as shown in the mobile app as well.</p>  
            </div>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This redesign project exercised my ability to pay attention to details and maintain consistency while creating a design 
                    that is user-friendly. I had to think strategically when moving functions around so the user would not get confused and 
                    the functionality would still feel familiar.
