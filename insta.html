                <h1>Instagram Website Redesign</h1>
                <p style="text-align: center;">I challenged myself to redesign the web application for Instagram and create a design that 
                    is consistent with the mobile app.</p>
            </div>

            <!--Introduction-->
            <div class="element" id="section1">
                <h1>Project Introduction</h1>
                <p>I use Instagram daily, as do many other young adults. However, I use it primarily on my mobile phone. I wanted to challenge 
                    myself to look into the UI/UX design of Instagram’s web application and try to improve the design.  
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="element">
                <h1>Home Page</h1>
                <p>I feel that the reels, create post, and profile sections of the app are in sync with the mobile app and make sense for the website. With 
                     that being said, I found a few changes that I could make within the home, search, explore, messages, and notifications sections
                </p>

                <p>
                    When logging into Instagram, the first thing a user sees is their homepage. In the current design, I like that the
                     posts and stories are in the middle of the page, simulating the same feeling we get from the mobile application. 
                     Viewing and adding comments has easy functionality as well. However, I would like to explore different options within
                      the right margin to add functionality.
                </p>

                <img src="assets/og-home.png" alt="Original Home Design">

                <p>
                    In the mobile app, the messages and notifications are separate from the bottom navigation bar. On the website however, 
                    they are added to the side navigation bar. Additionally, the elements in the navigation bar are in a different order on 
                    the website than the mobile app. In my redesign, I want to maintain consistency between the mobile and web design of the 
                    navigation bar. 
                </p>
                <img src="assets/og-nav.png" alt="Website Navigation">
                <p>Website Navigation</p>
                <img src="assets/mobile-nav.jpeg" alt="Mobile Navigation">
                <p>Mobile Navigation</p>
            </div>

            <div class="element">
                <h1>Search and Explore Page</h1>
                <p>
                    In the mobile app, the search icon shows the users explore page with a search bar at the top for any specific searches. 
                    However when moving to the web version, there are two separate pages to view the explore page and to search. In my redesign,
                     I will maintain consistency between the mobile and web versions by combining the search and explore pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, in the mobile version, the user can search a keyword and have the option to view related results as “for you”,
                     “accounts”, “audio”, “tags”, “places”, and “reels” but when searching on the website the results are only posts. I will also 
                     maintain consistency by adding these filter options for search results. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Redesign Goals-->
            <div class="element" id="section2">
                <h1>Redesign Goals</h1>
                <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    <li>Create navigation similar to mobile app navigation</li>
                    <li>Give functionality to right margin</li>
                    <li>Combine Search and Explore Pages</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <img src="assets/redesign-home.png" alt="Home Redesign">
                <p>The updated navigation bar on the side reflects the mobile app navigation. The messages and notifications were moved 
                    to the top right as well. </p>

                <img src="assets/messages2.png" alt="Messages Redesign">
                <p>When the user selects the messages icon, messages will appear on the right margin. They can select a 
                    specific chatroom to open the full messages page.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Notifications</p>
                <img src="assets/redesign-notifs.png" alt="Notifications Redesign">
                <p>When the user selects the heart icon, the notifications will appear on the right hand side. They will stay on the right
                     as the user scrolls until they reselect the heart icon to close the notifications view.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Search and Explore</p>

                <img src="assets/search3.png" alt="Seach Redesign">
                <p>The search icon now takes the user to the search and explore page, as structured in the mobile app. When searching, 
                    the user gets search suggestions. Once they complete their search, they have the option to look at for you suggestions, 
                    accounts, audios, tags, places, and reels as shown in the mobile app as well.</p>  
            </div>

            <div class="element" id="section4">
                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>This redesign project exercised my ability to pay attention to details and maintain consistency while creating a design 
                    that is user-friendly. I had to think strategically when moving functions around so the user would not get confused and 
                    the functionality would still feel familiar.
