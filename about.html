                <text>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Kaila Anderson and Iâ€™m a UI/UX Designer from Youngstown Ohio. My journey began with a passion 
                        for playing games, which led me to initially pursue game programming. During my studies as a Bachelor of Science 
                        Computer Science major, I discovered my true calling in the art and design classes, prompting me to switch to a
                        Bachelor of Arts and delve into the world of UI/UX Design.</p>
                    <p>Despite the seemingly abrupt shift, my background in Computer Science and Game Programming has been invaluable
                        in UI/UX Design. It enables me to create designs that are both aesthetically pleasing and technically feasible.
                        My experience encompasses user research, user testing, and the ability to design engaging interfaces for mobile 
                        apps, websites, and games. </p>
                    <p>With each project, my goal is to craft user-friendly designs that surpass previous efforts. I value the process
                        of creating and the joy it brings, constantly pushing myself to grow alongside my peers.</p>
                    <p>Outside of design, I enjoy exploring new ideas and concepts, always seeking inspiration. I strive to create work 
                        that is not only functional but enjoyable, ensuring that every user has a delightful experience. </p>
